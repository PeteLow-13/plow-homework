WHEN I viewed the HTML there were <div>s  instead of semantic elements
THEN I replaced the <div>s with semantic elements
WHEN I tested buttons one was not functional
THEN I made it functional
WHEN I veiwed the heading elements they we're not properly ordered. 
THEN I corrected and put them in proper order
WHEN I looked at the CSS I was able to greatly reduce its number of entries after using semantic element tags in the HTML and using correct elements to tag in leiu of using <class> to identify attributed for each element.
